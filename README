            Uniform Polyhedra - Computation and 3D Display
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


    Uniform polyhedra, whose faces are regular and vertices equivalent, have
been studied since antiquity. Best known are the 5 Platonic solids and the 13
Archimedean solids. We then have 2 infinite families of uniform prisms and anti
prisms. Allowing for star faces and vertices, we have the 4 Kepler-Poinsot
regular star polyhedra, and a row of 53 nonconvex uniform polyhedra discovered
in the 1880's and the 1930's. The complete set appeared in print for the first
time in 1953, in a paper by Coxeter, Longuet-Higgins and Miller. Wenninger's
1971 book "Polyhedron Models" contains photos and building instructions for
cardboard models of the 75 uniform polyhedra.

    In the paper "Uniform Solution for Uniform Polyhedra", published in
Geometriae Dedicata, 47 (1993), 57-110, we propose a uniform approach to an
arbitrary precision solution of uniform polyhedra and their duals, given a
simple formula which describes the method of generation of each polyhedron by
successive reflections in a trihedral kaleidoscope. The theory is complemented
by 8 tables and 160 computer generated figures. A postscript version of the
paper, along with C programs implementing the algorithms, are available for
anonymous ftp from ftp.math.technion.ac.il, from the directory kaleido, or,
through the Word-Wide Web, from the URL:
http://www.math.technion.ac.il/kaleido/.

    The program kaleido may be used, without any further programming, to
compute the metrical properties of the polyhedra, such as angles and radii. and
their combinatorial properties, such as the Euler characteristic and the
covering density. Furthermore, the program is capable of generating Cartesian
coordinates for the vertices and faces, which are then used to display a
rotating wire-frame images of the polyhedra, with depth simulated by edge
brightness, and to generate a pic file which can be included in any TeX or
troff manuscript. The computational features are available on any machine with
a decent C compiler.  The graphic features are currently available for Unix
machines with X Windows or LucasFilm graphics, UNIX V/386 machines, and MS-DOS
machines, but may be extended quite easily to other graphic environments. The
source code is carefully broken into small logical units, so it may be used by
an experienced programmer in any environment which requires a precise
computation of polyhedra, such as a computer modeling software.

    The source code may be found in kaleido/src, and the documentation in 
kaleido/doc. In addition, we provide in kaleido several subdirectories
which include executable code for common platforms, e.g., x-msdos, x-linux,
x-sparc, etc. Each subdirectory has a README file, for further information.

    To fetch the software, in a compressed tar format, use the ftp command
    ftp>   get kaleido.tar.Z
or to fetch a single subdirectory, use the commands
    ftp>   cd kaleido
    ftp>   get src.tar.Z
etc. These commands use the ftp features of automatic archiving and
compression.

    If you use a WWW browser to access our archive, we provide appropriate
hooks to get single files or whole directories. More information about the
Technion Mathematics Department in general and its FTP archive in particular
may be obtained from the URL: http://www.math.technion.ac.il/.

	 As an illustration to kaleido's  possibilities, kaleido may produce
virtual reality models (using VRML97) of the polyhedra, which can be viewed
using any current VRML browser. Each polyhedron face is solid, colored
according to its valency using a simple color coding. To overcome the
limitations of the browsers, faces bounded by self-intersecting polygons are
broken down to simple sub-faces by insertion of auxiliary vertices. Screen
dumps of the models, and the VRML files themselves, may be viewed in the URL:
